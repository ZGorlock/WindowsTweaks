The maximum folder views cache size is 5000 by default
The cache size can be increased up to 20000
This tweak will set the cache size to 20000 by default

To make a backup of your folder views cache:
	Run 'save backup of folder views cache.bat'

To see the current size of the folder views cache:
	Run 'view current number of cached folder views.ps1'

To set a custom value for the cache size:
	Using a text editor, Open: 'increase maximum number of folder views to cache.reg'
		Edit the dword value of "BagMRU Size" to the hexidecimal of your custom value
		Examples:
				20000 =>	"BagMRU Size"=dword:00004e20
				10000 =>	"BagMRU Size"=dword:00002710
				 5000 =>	"BagMRU Size"=dword:00001388
		Ensure the configured value is reasonable (between 5000 and 20000)
		Then save the script

Run 'increase maximum number of folder views to cache.reg'

Run '..\Scripts\bat\restart_explorer.bat'

Reboot

To completely clear the folder views cache:
	See 'reset all cached folder views.txt'
