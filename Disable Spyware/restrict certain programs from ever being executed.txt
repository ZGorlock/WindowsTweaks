You can block particular programs from ever being executed based on their file names

Using a text editor, Open: 'restrict certain programs from ever being executed.reg'

	For the script to do anything you will need to uncomment the commands by removing the ";"
		The first section will enable the ability to block execution of programs
		The second section specifies which file names to be blocked
	
	When defining the programs to block:
		They are numbered because you are able to block more than one file
			Make sure they are in order and start with "1"
			You may also block more than "3" if you choose
		Pay attention if you have already blocked programs before
			If you run this script again later, the existing value of "1" may be overwritten based on what you uncomment
	
	Replace the fake executable name(s) with those of the programs you want to block
		Then save the script

Run: 'restrict certain programs from ever being executed.reg'

To allow a program to be executed again, delete its value from the key:
	[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\DisallowRun]
