# Windows Tweaks

### This is a collection of registry changes and step-by-step instructions on how to make modifications to Windows 10

### *** USE AT YOUR OWN RISK ***

## Notes

### More than anything, this is a backup of my notes on how I set my computer up the way that I prefer, in case I ever need to do it again.

### And if someone else is able to benefit from it as well, then that is even better.

\
That being said, ***there is no guarantee associated with these tweaks.*** 
\
While they may have worked for me, they may not work for you, 
or maybe they do not work anymore, or maybe they work but not in the way you expected.

***Always make a backup and restore point before messing with the registry.***

\
Some other points to keep in mind:

* Do not run these files blindly; make sure you read and understand what it is doing first
* If there are two files with the same name, always read the .txt file first
* The file name indicates the general function of that tweak
* You do not want all of these; many are specific to my needs / file system / etc.
* Always replace usernames with your username, and file paths with ones that make sense for you
* These were run on a Windows 10 Pro operating system; if you do not have Pro you will not have the Group Policy Editor
