Because we're using a custom name, you must open the Registry file with Notepad or any text editor. 

Look for My New Folder and change that to the folder name you want.

You can use any name for the default folder, but \ / ? : * " > < | ' are not allowed. 

Or, see the Tutorial Link to manually edit the registry.
