First ensure that dark mode is enabled:
	Run 'enable dark mode.reg' if needed

Run 'enable dark window title bars.reg'
	This will enable dark title bars for all windows
	If any changes are made to the theme or color scheme this will have to be run again

To remove the accent color from the border of Explorer windows after this change:
	Run 'disable explorer border accents.reg'
